# MA678_Midterm_CancerData
Repo for the midterm project for Boston University's MSSP MA678 course.  
The main data files are:
- "glioblastoma_data.R", which reads in the relevant data, cleans it, and visualizes it in several ways, including scatterplots with the different predictors and a map as well
- "glioblastoma_regression.R", which includes the modeling
- "final-report.Rmd" and its corresponding pdf, which is the written report. 

The txt files read into "glioblastoma_data.R" are the relevant ones; the rest are for my personal exploration. This includes the "data_reading.R"" and "data_visualization.R"" files as well.
